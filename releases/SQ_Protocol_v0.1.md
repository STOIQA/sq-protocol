# 🚀 SQ Protocol v0.1 – First Public Draft

The **SQ (Synthesis Quotient) Protocol** is an open format for sharing creative intent across AI tools using a clean, permission-based scene format.

This first release includes:
- 🎬 `scene.json` – Defines the core scene: mood, timing, characters, and intent
- 🔐 `permission.json` – Sets limits: who can act, where intent can go, and how long
- 🎼 `cue_sheets/` – Sync audio/visual/motion across tools
- 📜 SQIP proposals: `SQIP-0002` (Permissions) & `SQIP-0003` (Cue Sheets)
