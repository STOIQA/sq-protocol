# SQIP-0005 — Federation + Fallback Agent Logic

## Overview

This SQIP proposes a structure for enabling multi-agent collaboration in creative workflows, where different AI services or agents perform specialized roles (e.g., scriptwriting, voice, visual generation) and can fall back to alternatives if a service fails or is unavailable.

## Motivation

As creative AI workflows become more complex, they benefit from a modular, resilient architecture. This structure must support:

- Tool specialization (best agent for the job)
- Cross-agent communication
- Fallbacks and substitutions
- Permission & intent enforcement

## Architecture

The proposed model follows a **Federation with Fallbacks** pattern:

1. **Intent JSON** is parsed from scene+permission.
2. Each scene component is matched to an available agent by type and capability.
3. If an agent fails or is unavailable, the system:
   - Checks the fallback list
   - Re-routes the request
4. Agents confirm execution and return artifacts or logs.

## Agent Profile Example

```json
{
  "agent_id": "voice-suno",
  "type": "voice",
  "capabilities": ["generate", "edit"],
  "fallbacks": ["voice-elevenlabs", "voice-fakeyou"]
}
```

## Flow Summary

1. Scene and permission are parsed.
2. For each asset:
   - Agent is selected based on type + priority
   - Execution is attempted
   - If fails → fallback
3. Output is logged and versioned
4. Result is stored or handed off

## Benefits

- Graceful degradation
- Modular integration (plug agents in/out)
- Supports agent reputation, priority, and version control
- Strengthens distributed interoperability across creative AI

## Status

**Draft** — Comments welcome.
