# SQIP-0003: Cue Sheets and Synchronization Structure

## üìå Title
Cue Sheets for Time-Based AI Scene Coordination

## üß† Summary
This SQIP defines a shared format for `cue_sheets/`, allowing AI agents to synchronize on time, action, and progression using a lightweight, human-readable spec. It allows scenes to unfold in coordinated layers across media tools (e.g. visuals + sound + motion).

---

## üîç Motivation

Current AI scenes lack structured timing coordination. A monster might sing before the music is cued, or visuals appear unsynced from narrative moments.

Cue Sheets solve this by offering a universal timestamped breakdown ‚Äî like a film score or animation board ‚Äî for AI to align creative actions.

```txt
00:00.000 | cue:start | Character: Noggin starts tapping beat
00:04.500 | cue:layer | Mammott joins harmony
00:08.000 | cue:build | PomPom + Furcorn jump into frame
00:11.000 | cue:form  | Island begins to shape into logo
00:14.000 | cue:chorus| All monsters sing full chorus
00:18.000 | cue:end   | Logo revealed, fade out
```
