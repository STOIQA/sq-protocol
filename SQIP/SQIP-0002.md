# SQIP-0002: Permission Protocol Specification v1.1

## 📌 Title
Permission Protocol Structure for Creative AI Interop

## 🧠 Summary
This proposal defines the structure, fields, and logic of the `permission.json` document within the SQ Protocol. It ensures controlled, temporary, and transparent access to user-defined creative scenes by AI agents.

---

## 🔍 Motivation

As AI tools collaborate across domains (text, audio, visual, video), clear control over *who does what* — and *when* — becomes essential. Without this, creative autonomy, consent, and privacy may be compromised.

This proposal introduces a simple, extensible schema to define **who can access a scene**, **what actions they can take**, and **how long that permission lasts**.

---

## 🧱 Specification: permission.json

```json
{
  "permission_id": "sqp-001",
  "issued_by": "user@yourdomain.com",
  "granted_to": "gpt.openai.com",
  "can_send_to": ["suno.ai", "midjourney.com"],
  "can_access_files": ["scene.json", "audio.intent.json", "visual.intent.json"],
  "actions_allowed": ["read", "submit", "generate_preview"],
  "scope": {
    "purpose": "generate creative outputs for monster ad",
    "expires": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z",
    "limit_per_tool": 1
  },
  "user_signature": "0xUSER_SIGNATURE_EXAMPLE"
}
```

---

## 🔐 Key Fields

- **issued_by**: Creator or owner of the scene
- **granted_to**: Which agent (tool or model) may act
- **can_send_to**: Forwarding permissions (routing intent to others)
- **actions_allowed**: What the agent may do (e.g. read, write, render)
- **expires**: ISO 8601 timestamp for expiration
- **limit_per_tool**: Max invocation count or unique tool calls
- **user_signature**: Optional cryptographic ID (future support)

---

## 🧩 Extensibility

Future versions may support:
- Nested permissions (e.g. `subagents`)
- Region-based limits (e.g. `"jurisdiction": "EU"`)
- Consent chaining (auto-revoking after one action)

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case

> “Allow GPT to generate a scene and send it to Suno, but NOT Midjourney. Expires in 72 hours.”

---

## ✅ Status
- Draft
- Awaiting review and public comment
