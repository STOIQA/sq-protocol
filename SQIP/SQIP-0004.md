# SQIP-0004: Advanced Interop ‚Äì Intent Graphs, Agent Profiles & Event Hooks

## üìå Title
Composable Interop via Scene Graphs, Agent Capabilities & Callback Events

## üß† Summary
This proposal enhances the SQ Protocol with modular scene architecture, agent profiles, and event-based orchestration, enabling fully interoperable, decentralized, and asynchronous AI collaboration.

---

## üîç Motivation

Current `scene.json` and `permission.json` formats assume linear use. As protocols evolve across tools like GPT, Suno, Runway, and Veo, we need:

- Multi-agent orchestration
- Tool self-declaration (capabilities, formats)
- Graph-based scene breakdowns
- Event-driven progression
- Optional verification and permission expiry

---

## üîó Components

### 1. Intent Graph

Replaces a flat scene with a modular node tree.

```json
{
  "id": "scene-01",
  "type": "scene",
  "intent": "intro_sequence",
  "children": [
    { "id": "suno-audio", "type": "music", "tool": "suno" },
    { "id": "runway-video", "type": "video", "tool": "runway" },
    { "id": "dialog-voice", "type": "voice", "tool": "11labs" }
  ]
}
```

---

### 2. Agent Capabilities (agents.json)

Each AI tool provides a discovery file:

```json
{
  "agent": "suno",
  "version": "1.2",
  "capabilities": ["music", "harmony", "chorus"],
  "formats": ["wav", "mp3"],
  "permissions": {
    "requires": ["cue_sheet", "scene.intent"],
    "can_write": ["output/audio.wav"]
  }
}
```

---

### 3. Event Callback System

Tools can trigger others via "on_complete":

```json
{
  "on_complete": {
    "agent": "suno",
    "action": "notify",
    "send_to": "runway",
    "with_file": "output/audio.wav"
  }
}
```

---

### 4. Verification & Expiry (optional)

```json
{
  "scene_hash": "0xabc123...",
  "signature": "0xdeadbeef...",
  "expires_at": "2025-08-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

---

## üì¶ Interop Modes

### 1. File-based Chaining (Manual or Semi-Automated)

Each tool generates a file (e.g. `scene.json`, `.wav`, `.png`) that can be uploaded into the next. This supports:

- Easy integration without API dependencies
- Human-in-the-loop workflows
- Tools only need basic import support (upload/dropzone)

### 2. Live API-Linked Chaining (Permission Protocol)

Agents communicate directly using pre-authorized intents defined in `permission.json`. Enables:

- Seamless tool-to-tool data exchange
- Real-time orchestration between tools
- Fully automated creative pipelines

---

## üõ† Use Case Example

1. GPT generates `scene.json` (as a graph)
2. Suno reads node, outputs `audio.wav`
3. Scene triggers Veo (visual node), referencing `audio.wav`
4. All tools obey permissions set in `permission.json`
5. A viewer/debugger shows sync timeline

## ‚úÖ Status

- Drafted for future SQP releases (v0.2+)
- Supports validator and agent capability discovery
- Next: sample implementation testing with real toolchains
