# SQIP-0001: Initial Proposal for SQ Protocol

Defines the structure of `scene.json` as the standard format for sharing intent between creative AI tools. Modular media blocks and clear time cues allow orchestration of visuals, music, and video from a single source of truth.

## Sections:
- Scene metadata
- Timeline
- Media intent
- Future extensibility (camera cues, dialog, input maps)
