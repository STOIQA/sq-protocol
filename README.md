# SQ Protocol – The Creative Interop Standard

**SQ (Synthesis Quotient) Protocol** is an open, scene-based format for sharing creative intent between AI systems — including audio, visual, video, and narrative.

It enables tools like GPT, Suno, Midjourney, and Veo to speak a shared creative language.

## 🔥 Features
- Scene-based JSON structure
- Media-specific intent blocks
- Permission-based handoff
- Built to be extended, forked, and remixed

## 📁 Structure
- `specs/` – Core scene structure format
- `permission/` – Access control schema
- `cue_sheets/` – Time-based scene planning
- `SQIP/` – Proposals for improvements to the protocol

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Open and edit `scene.json` to describe your scene
3. Use `permission.json` to grant specific AI agents temporary task access
4. Share or integrate into tools (manually or via adapters)
