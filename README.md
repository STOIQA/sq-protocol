# SQ Protocol – The Creative Interop Standard for AI Media

**SQ (Synthesis Quotient) Protocol** is an open, scene-based format for sharing creative intent across AI tools — enabling storytelling through structured sound, visuals, and behavior.

## 🎯 What It Solves

Today’s AI tools are brilliant — but fragmented. You might write a story in GPT, generate audio in Suno, make visuals in MJ, then cut it in Veo… but none of them **speak the same creative language**.

**SQ Protocol is that language.**

## ⚙️ How It Works

- `scene.json` → A structured breakdown of creative timing, media types, characters, moods, etc.
- `permission.json` → Who can use it, where it can be sent, for how long
- `cue_sheets/` → Optional linear or musical planning guides

AI tools read `scene.json`, check `permission.json`, and can act — securely and in sync.

## 🧠 Example Use Case: 30s Ad with Singing Monsters

1. A stone monster (Noggin) starts tapping a beat
2. Others join in layer by layer — Mammott, PomPom, Furcorn, etc.
3. They run into frame singing, camera zooms out, and the island forms the **logo**
4. Tools like Suno, Midjourney, and Veo each render their part based on the same shared intent

## 🌍 Vision

> Imagine a world where **every creative AI tool interoperates** —  
> where **your intent flows freely**, and where agents build in harmony instead of isolation.

This is SQ Protocol v0.1 — just the beginning.
